## 1. Introduction

### Overview:

State channels are a Layer 2 scaling solution that allows participants to conduct off-chain transactions with the guarantee that the final state can be settled on-chain. This document outlines the design of a State Channel Layer 2 solution with integrated shard management, cross-shard transaction protocols, and methods to ensure atomicity in transaction processing. It aims to reduce on-chain transaction costs, increase transaction throughput, and maintain security and integrity within the blockchain ecosystem.

### Goals and Objectives:

- Design a transaction process for creating and managing shards with specific rules and consensus algorithms.
- Implement a two-phase commit protocol for cross-shard transaction atomicity.
- Define and develop the protocol for state channel creation and management.
- Develop protocols to process, verify, and finalize transactions within state channels.
- Ensure seamless channel closure and on-chain updates to reflect the final state.

## 2. System Architecture

### Shard Creation and Management Rules

- **Shard Creation Transaction Design**: A transaction design is necessary to govern the creation of shards. It involves:
  - The number of nodes required to form a shard.
  - Selection of a consensus algorithm for the shard (e.g., PoS, PoA).
  - Protocols for shard governance and updates.

- **Transaction Design**:
  - Each shard creation transaction will specify the configuration of the shard, including node count and consensus rules.
  - A shard registry smart contract on Layer 1 will be responsible for tracking the created shards.

- **Rules for Managing Shards**:
  - Shard nodes are dynamically allocated based on network load.
  - Shard configuration can be updated through governance mechanisms involving the shard's validators.

### Cross-Shard Transaction Processing

- **Two-Phase Commit Protocol**:
  - For cross-shard transactions where atomicity is critical, the two-phase commit protocol ensures that either all participating shards commit the transaction, or all rollback.
  - **Phase 1: Prepare**: All participating shards lock resources and prepare to commit.
  - **Phase 2: Commit**: If all shards are prepared, they commit. If any shard fails, all revert to the previous state.

- **Failure Handling**:
  - If any shard reports a failure during the preparation phase, all other shards must abort the transaction, and the state is rolled back.

### State Channel Creation and Management

- **Protocol for State Channel Creation**:
  - Participants initiate a state channel by depositing an initial fund on Layer 1 (on-chain).
  - The state channel is opened and registered on-chain with an identifier.
  - Rules for the initial deposit, channel lifetime, and the number of participants are defined.

- **Management of Active State Channels**:
  - Participants can perform any number of off-chain transactions while the channel is open.
  - All off-chain transactions are signed by both parties and not published on-chain unless a dispute arises.

### Transaction Processing and Verification in State Channels

- **Off-chain Transaction Handling**:
  - Off-chain transactions are exchanged between the parties directly, without involving the blockchain.
  - Each transaction is cryptographically signed by all participants.
  
- **Transaction Confirmation**:
  - Once the participants agree on the final state (last signed transaction), it can be submitted on-chain for settlement.
  - Disputes can be resolved by submitting the last known valid state to the blockchain for arbitration.

### Channel Closure and Final Record

- **Protocol for Channel Closure**:
  - A state channel can be closed by mutual agreement or when the predefined time expires.
  - The final state is submitted to Layer 1 to settle the results.

- **On-chain Update**:
  - Upon channel closure, the final state is recorded on-chain, and any remaining funds are distributed accordingly.
  - The on-chain contract is updated to reflect the outcome of the state channel.

## 3. Protocols and Algorithms

### Shard Creation Protocol:

1. **Input**: Number of nodes, consensus algorithm, and governance rules.
2. **Output**: A new shard with unique shard ID, validator set, and consensus mechanism.
3. **Execution**:
   - Transaction initiates shard creation.
   - Validators are selected, and governance rules are applied.

```javascript
const Ain = require('@ainblockchain/ain-js'); // Require ain-js SDK
const ain = new Ain('https://testnet-api.ainetwork.ai'); // Connect to AIN blockchain

// Your app-specific path
const appPath = '/my_app';

// 1. Define input parameters for shard creation
const shardCreationData = {
  shardId: 'shard_001',
  nodeCount: 5, // Number of nodes in this shard
  consensusAlgorithm: 'PoS', // Consensus mechanism, e.g., PoS or PoA
  governanceRules: {
    votingThreshold: 0.6, // 60% threshold for decisions
    updateInterval: 3600, // 1 hour between governance updates
  },
  validators: ['validator_1', 'validator_2', 'validator_3'], // Selected validators for the shard
};

// 2. Shard Creation: Define a path where shard information will be stored
const shardPath = `${appPath}/shards/${shardCreationData.shardId}`;

// 3. Write shard creation rules and transaction on the blockchain
ain.db.ref(shardPath).setValue({
  value: {
    shardId: shardCreationData.shardId,
    nodeCount: shardCreationData.nodeCount,
    consensusAlgorithm: shardCreationData.consensusAlgorithm,
    governanceRules: shardCreationData.governanceRules,
    validators: shardCreationData.validators,
    status: 'active',
  },
  nonce: -1,
}).then((res) => {
  console.log("Shard creation transaction result:", JSON.stringify(res, null, 2));
});

// 4. Define governance rules (optional) â€“ can be extended for on-chain governance mechanisms
const governancePath = `${appPath}/governance/${shardCreationData.shardId}`;
ain.db.ref(governancePath).setValue({
  value: {
    votingThreshold: shardCreationData.governanceRules.votingThreshold,
    updateInterval: shardCreationData.governanceRules.updateInterval,
  },
  nonce: -1,
}).then((res) => {
  console.log("Governance rules set:", JSON.stringify(res, null, 2));
});

// 5. Confirm shard and validator setup
ain.db.ref(`${shardPath}/validators`).getValue().then((res) => {
  console.log("Shard Validators:", res);
}).catch((err) => {
  console.log("Error fetching shard validators:", err);
});
```

### Two-Phase Commit Protocol:

1. **Prepare Phase**: Participating shards prepare for the transaction by locking resources.
2. **Commit Phase**: If all shards successfully prepare, they commit the transaction. If any shard fails, the entire transaction is rolled back.
```javascript
const Ain = require('@ainblockchain/ain-js'); // Require ain-js SDK
const ain = new Ain('https://testnet-api.ainetwork.ai'); // Connect to AIN blockchain

// Your app-specific path
const appPath = '/my_app';

// List of shards participating in the two-phase commit
const shards = [
  'shard_001',
  'shard_002'
];

// Transaction data for the two-phase commit
const transactionData = {
  transactionId: 'txn_12345',
  value: 100, // Sample value being transferred or processed
  resource: 'resource_token', // Resource being locked
};

// 1. Prepare Phase: Check if all participating shards can lock the required resources
async function preparePhase(shards, transactionData) {
  const preparePromises = shards.map(shard => {
    const preparePath = `${appPath}/shards/${shard}/transactions/${transactionData.transactionId}/prepare`;
    return ain.db.ref(preparePath).setValue({
      value: {
        status: 'prepared',
        resource: transactionData.resource,
        locked: true,
      },
      nonce: -1,
    });
  });
  
  try {
    const prepareResults = await Promise.all(preparePromises);
    console.log("Prepare phase results:", prepareResults);
    return prepareResults.every(result => result.code === 0); // Check if all shards prepared successfully
  } catch (err) {
    console.error("Error in Prepare Phase:", err);
    return false;
  }
}

// 2. Commit Phase: If preparation was successful, commit the transaction. Otherwise, rollback.
async function commitPhase(success, shards, transactionData) {
  const commitPromises = shards.map(shard => {
    const commitPath = `${appPath}/shards/${shard}/transactions/${transactionData.transactionId}/commit`;
    return ain.db.ref(commitPath).setValue({
      value: {
        status: success ? 'committed' : 'rolled_back',
        resource: transactionData.resource,
        locked: false, // Unlock resources whether we commit or rollback
      },
      nonce: -1,
    });
  });

  try {
    const commitResults = await Promise.all(commitPromises);
    console.log(success ? "Commit phase results:" : "Rollback phase results:", commitResults);
    return commitResults;
  } catch (err) {
    console.error("Error in Commit/Rollback Phase:", err);
  }
}

// 3. Execute Two-Phase Commit: Run the two phases in sequence
async function executeTwoPhaseCommit(shards, transactionData) {
  console.log("Starting Prepare Phase...");
  const prepareSuccess = await preparePhase(shards, transactionData);
  
  if (prepareSuccess) {
    console.log("Prepare Phase successful, starting Commit Phase...");
    await commitPhase(true, shards, transactionData);
  } else {
    console.log("Prepare Phase failed, rolling back...");
    await commitPhase(false, shards, transactionData);
  }
}

// Initiating the Two-Phase Commit Protocol
executeTwoPhaseCommit(shards, transactionData);

```

### State Channel Creation Protocol:

1. **Channel Initialization**: Initial deposit made by participants to a smart contract.
2. **Off-chain Transactions**: Participants perform transactions off-chain, updating the channel state.
3. **Dispute Resolution**: If a dispute arises, the final state is submitted on-chain for resolution.

```javascript
const Ain = require('@ainblockchain/ain-js'); // Require ain-js SDK
const ain = new Ain('https://testnet-api.ainetwork.ai'); // Connect to AIN blockchain

// Your app-specific path
const appPath = '/my_app';
const myAddress = '0xYourAddress'; // Replace with your address

// State Channel Initialization Data with arbitrary data fields
const stateChannelData = {
  channelId: 'channel_12345',
  participants: ['participant_1', 'participant_2'], // List of participants
  initialData: {
    participant_1_data: { key1: 'value1', key2: 'value2' },
    participant_2_data: { key1: 'valueA', key2: 'valueB' }, // Initial data from both participants
  },
  state: {
    participant_1_data: { key1: 'value1', key2: 'value2' },
    participant_2_data: { key1: 'valueA', key2: 'valueB' }, // The current state of data for both participants
  },
};

// 1. State Channel Initialization (On-Chain)

async function initializeStateChannel(channelData) {
  const channelPath = `${appPath}/channels/${channelData.channelId}`;
  
  const result = await ain.db.ref(channelPath).setValue({
    value: {
      participants: channelData.participants,
      state: channelData.state,
      initialData: channelData.initialData,
      status: 'open',
    },
    nonce: -1,
  });
  
  console.log("State Channel Initialization Result:", result);
}

// 2. Off-chain Transaction Handling (Off-chain)

function performOffchainTransaction(currentState, participant, updatedData) {
  // Off-chain state update with arbitrary data
  currentState[`${participant}_data`] = { ...currentState[`${participant}_data`], ...updatedData };
  return currentState;
}

// Example of multiple off-chain transactions (Off-chain)
let currentState = { ...stateChannelData.state }; // Clone current state

// Transaction 1: Participant 1 updates their data
currentState = performOffchainTransaction(currentState, 'participant_1', { key2: 'new_value2' });
console.log("After Transaction 1:", currentState);

// Transaction 2: Participant 2 adds a new key-value pair
currentState = performOffchainTransaction(currentState, 'participant_2', { key3: 'valueC' });
console.log("After Transaction 2:", currentState);

// Transaction 3: Participant 1 adds more data
currentState = performOffchainTransaction(currentState, 'participant_1', { key3: 'new_value3', key4: 'extra_value4' });
console.log("After Transaction 3:", currentState);

// Transaction 4: Participant 2 updates an existing key
currentState = performOffchainTransaction(currentState, 'participant_2', { key1: 'updated_valueA' });
console.log("After Transaction 4:", currentState);

// Transaction 5: Participant 1 deletes a key by setting it to null
currentState = performOffchainTransaction(currentState, 'participant_1', { key2: null });
console.log("After Transaction 5:", currentState);

// 3. Dispute Resolution (On-Chain Submission of Final State)

async function submitFinalState(channelData, finalState) {
  const channelPath = `${appPath}/channels/${channelData.channelId}/final_state`;

  const result = await ain.db.ref(channelPath).setValue({
    value: {
      finalState: finalState,
      status: 'closed',
    },
    nonce: -1,
  });

  console.log("Final State Submission Result:", result);
}

// Simulate a dispute resolution by submitting the final state on-chain
submitFinalState(stateChannelData, currentState);

// Initialize the state channel
initializeStateChannel(stateChannelData);

```

### Channel Closure Protocol:

1. **Mutual Agreement**: Participants agree to close the channel and submit the final state.
2. **Final Settlement**: The final state is written to the blockchain, and funds are distributed.
3. **On-chain Record Update**: The contract is updated to reflect the closure of the channel.

```javascript
const Ain = require('@ainblockchain/ain-js'); // Require ain-js SDK
const ain = new Ain('https://testnet-api.ainetwork.ai'); // Connect to AIN blockchain

// Your app-specific path
const appPath = '/my_app';
const channelId = 'channel_12345'; // Example channel ID

// 1. Channel Closure by Mutual Agreement (Final Off-chain State Agreement)
async function closeChannelByAgreement(finalState) {
  const channelPath = `${appPath}/channels/${channelId}/final_state`;
  
  // Step 1: Mutual Agreement to close channel (submit final state on-chain)
  const result = await ain.db.ref(channelPath).setValue({
    value: {
      finalState: finalState, // Agreed final state data
      status: 'closed',
    },
    nonce: -1,
  });

  console.log("Channel Closure by Mutual Agreement Result:", result);
}

// 2. Final Settlement (On-chain Final State Submission)
async function finalSettlement(finalState) {
  const settlementPath = `${appPath}/channels/${channelId}/settlement`;

  // Step 2: Final settlement on-chain based on final agreed state
  const result = await ain.db.ref(settlementPath).setValue({
    value: {
      settlementState: finalState, // The final settled state
      distributed: true, // Indicate that the settlement (funds or resources) has been distributed
    },
    nonce: -1,
  });

  console.log("Final Settlement Submission Result:", result);
}

// 3. On-chain Record Update (Channel Closure)
async function updateOnchainRecord() {
  const channelPath = `${appPath}/channels/${channelId}`;

  // Step 3: Update on-chain record to reflect channel closure
  const result = await ain.db.ref(channelPath).setValue({
    value: {
      status: 'closed', // Update channel status to 'closed'
      closedAt: Date.now(), // Timestamp for when the channel was closed
    },
    nonce: -1,
  });

  console.log("On-chain Channel Record Update Result:", result);
}

// Example final state after mutual agreement
const finalState = {
  participant_1_data: { key1: 'final_value1', key3: 'final_value3' },
  participant_2_data: { key1: 'final_valueA', key3: 'final_valueC' },
};

// Call the closure protocol functions in sequence
async function executeChannelClosureProtocol(finalState) {
  // Step 1: Mutual Agreement and Final State Submission
  await closeChannelByAgreement(finalState);
  
  // Step 2: Final Settlement based on the agreed final state
  await finalSettlement(finalState);
  
  // Step 3: Update On-chain Record for Channel Closure
  await updateOnchainRecord();
}

// Execute the full channel closure protocol
executeChannelClosureProtocol(finalState);
```

## 4. Security Considerations

- **Atomicity in Cross-Shard Transactions**: Two-phase commit protocol ensures atomicity across shards.
- **Dispute Resolution in State Channels**: Participants can submit the last valid state on-chain in case of disputes.
- **Off-chain Transaction Security**: Transactions are cryptographically signed by participants, ensuring integrity and non-repudiation.

---

## 5. Conclusion

This design document outlines a comprehensive approach to using State Channels and shard-based scaling to improve blockchain performance. By utilizing shard creation rules, cross-shard transaction handling, and secure state channel protocols, the proposed solution will help reduce on-chain transaction loads while maintaining high levels of security and efficiency.
