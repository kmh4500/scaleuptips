## 1. Introduction

### Overview:

The rapid advancement in artificial intelligence (AI) requires more efficient systems for managing and parallelizing the learning process. This document proposes a blockchain sharding protocol that enables the distributed management of AI learning states. By leveraging blockchain's immutability, transparency, and decentralized nature, we aim to optimize AI learning and task tracking.

### Goals and Objectives:

- Enable parallel execution and tracking of AI learning tasks through blockchain.
- Use blockchain sharding for efficient distribution of resources and task load.
- Ensure secure and traceable management of AI learning data.
- Enable dynamic resource allocation for AI operations via blockchain-based smart contracts.
- Manage access and permissions for AI learning tasks across multiple nodes.

## 2. System Architecture

### Blockchain Sharding Overview:

- **Sharding Definition**: The blockchain network will be divided into smaller partitions, known as "shards." Each shard handles a portion of the data and AI learning tasks, allowing for parallel processing.
- **Shards and AI Tasks**: AI learning states and data are distributed across multiple shards to enhance performance and scalability. Each shard operates independently but contributes to the global AI model.

### Key Components:

- **AI Nodes**: AI computation nodes performing the learning tasks.
- **Shards**: Blockchain shards storing data, AI task states, and managing resources.
- **Coordinator**: A central coordinator ensures the synchronization of learning states across shards.
- **Off-chain Nodes**: External storage nodes interacting with the blockchain to manage large datasets efficiently.

---

## 3. Data Management

### Data Storage Mechanism:

- AI learning-related data (e.g., model weights, parameters) is stored on off-chain nodes.
- The location and state of the data are referenced on-chain, ensuring traceability and immutability.

### Off-chain Data Handling:

- Off-chain nodes store the large datasets required for AI learning. Blockchain records references and metadata, allowing AI nodes to fetch the data as needed without overloading the blockchain.

### Blockchain Event Notification:

- Blockchain events trigger updates to off-chain nodes when new AI learning tasks or data become available. These events notify AI nodes about task assignments or data retrieval operations.

---

## 4. AI Task Tracking and Management

### Task Tracking on Blockchain:

- Each AI learning task is represented as a transaction on the blockchain. It includes information about task parameters, node assignment, and expected completion time.

### Recording AI Learning State:

- Learning states, such as model progress or intermediate results, are written to the blockchain, ensuring transparent tracking of AI task progress.

### Workflow and Status Update:

- Each learning task goes through defined states (e.g., pending, in-progress, completed) that are recorded in blocks. This allows real-time monitoring of the entire AI learning process across nodes.

---

## 5. Resource Allocation and Optimization

### Dynamic Resource Allocation:

- Smart contracts automatically allocate AI learning tasks to nodes based on available computational resources, task urgency, and network conditions. 
- The blockchain ensures equitable distribution of workloads across shards and AI nodes.

### Blockchain-based Optimization:

- The system dynamically adjusts task distribution to optimize resource usage, minimize latency, and balance the load. This optimization is recorded on-chain for auditability and future reference.

---

## 6. Access Control and Management

### Access Permissions via Smart Contracts:

- Access to AI learning tasks is controlled by smart contracts. These contracts govern which AI nodes can execute specific tasks based on their assigned roles and permissions.

### Route-based Authorization Rules:

- A set of rules is established to define access permissions to different paths of the AI Network. For example, certain AI nodes might only have access to model training data, while others can access and modify the learning parameters.

---

## 7. Technical Workflow

### Step-by-Step Workflow:

1. **Task Creation**: An AI task is initiated, and its metadata is recorded in a block.

```javascript
// 1. Task Creation
const taskPath = `${appPath}/tasks/${taskId}`;

ain.db.ref(taskPath).setRule({
  value: {
    '.rule': { 'write': "auth.addr === '0xtask_admin_address'" },
  },
  nonce: -1,
}).then((res) => {
  console.log("Write rule set:", JSON.stringify(res, null, 2));
});

const taskMetadata = {
  taskId: taskId,
  model: 'Llama-3-11B-Instruct-v0.1',
  status: 'pending',
  assignedTo: '0xnode_address1',
  createdAt: Date.now(),
};

ain.db.ref(taskPath).setValue({
  value: taskMetadata,
  nonce: -1,
}).then(res => {
  console.log("Task created:", JSON.stringify(res, null, 2));
});
```

2. **Data Retrieval**: Off-chain nodes are notified via blockchain events to provide required data for the task.
```javascript
const dataPath = `${appPath}/tasks/${taskMetadata.taskId}/data`;

// Set a function to trigger when data is needed
ain.db.ref(dataPath).setFunction({
  value: {
    '.function': {
      'data-retrieval-trigger': { // Function to retrieve data
        function_type: 'REST',
        function_url: 'http://data-node.ainetwork.ai/retrieve', // Example endpoint for data retrieval
        function_id: 'data-retrieval-trigger',
      },
    },
  },
  nonce: -1,
})
  .then((res) => {
    console.log("Data retrieval function set:", JSON.stringify(res, null, 2));
  });

// Notify off-chain nodes to provide data
ain.db.ref(`${dataPath}/request`).setValue({
  value: 'Requesting data for task_12345',
  nonce: -1,
})
  .then(res => {
    console.log("Data request sent:", JSON.stringify(res, null, 2));
  });
```

3. **Task Assignment**: The blockchain sharding protocol assigns the task to the appropriate shard and AI node based on resource availability.
```javascript
const assignPath = `${appPath}/tasks/${taskMetadata.taskId}/taskAssignment`;

// Assign the task to a node
ain.db.ref(assignPath).setValue({
  value: {
    assignedTo: '0xnode_address1',
    shard: 'Shard_1',
  },
  nonce: -1,
})
  .then(res => {
    console.log("Task assigned:", JSON.stringify(res, null, 2));
  });
```

4. **Learning State Update**: As the task progresses, updates are recorded on the blockchain.
```javascript
const updatePath = `${appPath}/tasks/${taskMetadata.taskId}/learningState/`;
// Set write rules for state updates
ain.db.ref(updatePath).setRule({
  value: {
    '.rule': {
      'write': "auth.addr == '0xnode_address1'",
    },
  },
  nonce: -1,
})
  .then((res) => {
    console.log("Write rule set for learning state:", JSON.stringify(res, null, 2));
  });

// Update the learning state
ain.db.ref(updatePath).setValue({
  value: {
    progress: '50%', // Example progress
    status: 'in-progress',
    updatedAt: Date.now(),
  },
  nonce: -1,
})
  .then(res => {
    console.log("Learning state updated:", JSON.stringify(res, null, 2));
  });
```
5. **Task Completion**: Upon completion, the final AI model state is stored on-chain, while large datasets remain off-chain.
```javascript
const completionPath = `${appPath}/tasks/${taskMetadata.taskId}/taskCompletion/`;

// Mark task as complete
ain.db.ref(completionPath).setValue({
  value: {
    status: 'completed',
    finalModelState: 'Llama-3-11B-Instruct-v0.1-finetuned', // Example model state
    completedAt: Date.now(),
  },
  nonce: -1,
})
  .then(res => {
    console.log("Task completion recorded:", JSON.stringify(res, null, 2));
  });
```
6. **Resource Reallocation**: Resources are freed up and reallocated dynamically for future tasks.
```javascript
const reallocationPath = `${appPath}/tasks/${taskMetadata.taskId}/resourceAllocation/`;

// Reallocate resources for future tasks
ain.db.ref(reallocationPath).setValue({
  value: {
    resourcesFreed: true,
    nextTaskAllocation: '0xnode_address1',
  },
  nonce: -1,
})
  .then(res => {
    console.log("Resource reallocation completed:", JSON.stringify(res, null, 2));
  });
```

### Use Case Scenarios:

- **AI Model Training**: Parallelized model training with task management across multiple shards.
- **Collaborative AI Systems**: Multiple nodes contributing to a global AI model with synchronized state management.

## 8. Security Considerations

### Encryption:

- All data stored on the blockchain and transmitted to off-chain nodes is encrypted to ensure confidentiality and integrity.

### Data Integrity:

- Blockchain's immutability ensures the integrity of AI learning states. Each state is cryptographically linked to previous ones, preventing unauthorized modifications.
