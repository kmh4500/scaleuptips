## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the design of a real-time event propagation system for off-chain containers, specifically focused on AI model training and inference transactions. The system monitors critical metrics such as GPU usage, memory, and temperature, and uses a blockchain-based solution to securely propagate transaction events. The goal is to ensure the integrity and traceability of off-chain events while maintaining high-performance operations in model training and inference.

**Goals:**

- Design an algorithm to capture and propagate model training and inference events in real-time.
- Develop a solution to monitor and log GPU, memory, and temperature usage from containers during AI operations.
- Use blockchain to ensure secure, real-time propagation and logging of these events.

## 2. System Architecture

The proposed architecture is divided into two primary components: **model training/inference transaction event propagation** and **monitoring/logging event propagation**. These two components work together to ensure real-time tracking and reporting of events generated in the off-chain container environment.

### Model Training/Inference Event Propagation

- **Event Sources**: AI models executing in containers generate events at key stages (e.g., batch completion, model evaluation, inference request).
- **Event Aggregation**: Events are collected through an event listener within the container.
- **Propagation Mechanism**: Events are transmitted securely to a blockchain or an external monitoring system. Each event contains metadata about the model state, parameters, and results.

### Monitoring and Logging Event Propagation

- **Container Metrics**: The system captures GPU usage, memory consumption, and temperature readings in real-time.
- **Event Logging**: Logs are generated periodically or on certain threshold conditions (e.g., high GPU usage).
- **Event Transmission**: These metrics are bundled into transaction events and transmitted to the blockchain for logging and traceability.

## 3. Transaction Event Propagation Algorithms

### Model Training/Inference Event Collection and Propagation

**Algorithm Overview**:

1. **Event Detection**: The event listener inside the container detects critical points in the model lifecycle (e.g., batch processing, model convergence).
2. **Event Aggregation**: Each event is packed with relevant data:
   - Model state (e.g., epoch number, loss function value)
   - Training parameters (e.g., learning rate, optimizer)
   - Inference results (e.g., accuracy, predictions)
3. **Event Propagation**:
   - **Step 1**: Package the event into a blockchain-compatible format.
   - **Step 2**: Transmit the event to the blockchain node, ensuring data integrity.
   - **Step 3**: Store a hash of the event on-chain for traceability, while the detailed data is logged off-chain.

### Monitoring and Logging Event Collection and Propagation

**Algorithm Overview**:

1. **Metrics Collection**:
   - Capture real-time GPU usage, memory consumption, and temperature data via monitoring agents installed in the container.
2. **Event Aggregation**:
   - Events are generated periodically (e.g., every 5 seconds) or when critical thresholds (e.g., >90% GPU usage) are exceeded.
   - Each event contains:
     - Timestamp
     - GPU usage (%)
     - Memory usage (%)
     - Temperature (째C)
3. **Event Propagation**:
   - **Step 1**: Bundle the metrics into an event payload.
   - **Step 2**: Transmit the event to the blockchain for logging.
   - **Step 3**: Store a hash of the event on-chain, while the detailed metrics are logged off-chain for further analysis.
```javascript
const Ain = require('@ainblockchain/ain-js'); // Import ain-js SDK
const ain = new Ain('https://testnet-api.ainetwork.ai'); // Connect to AIN blockchain

// Your app-specific path on AIN blockchain
const appPath = '/my_app';

// Sample function to simulate real-time metrics collection from a container (Replace with real monitoring)
function getContainerMetrics() {
  // Simulate real-time metrics data (Replace with actual monitoring tool data)
  return {
    gpuUsage: Math.random() * 100, // Random GPU usage percentage
    memoryUsage: Math.random() * 100, // Random Memory usage percentage
    temperature: Math.random() * 40 + 50, // Random temperature between 50째C and 90째C
    timestamp: Date.now(), // Current timestamp
  };
}

// Function to periodically collect metrics and propagate events
async function monitorAndLogMetrics() {
  const threshold = 90; // Example threshold for GPU usage

  setInterval(async () => {
    const metrics = getContainerMetrics(); // Get real-time container metrics

    console.log("Collected Metrics:", metrics);

    // Step 1: Check for threshold exceedance or regular event generation
    if (metrics.gpuUsage > threshold || metrics.memoryUsage > threshold || metrics.temperature > 85) {
      console.log('Threshold exceeded, generating event...');
    }

    // Step 2: Bundle the metrics into an event payload
    const eventPayload = {
      containerId: 'container_123', // Example container ID
      timestamp: metrics.timestamp,
      gpuUsage: metrics.gpuUsage,
      memoryUsage: metrics.memoryUsage,
      temperature: metrics.temperature,
      eventType: 'container_metrics', // Custom event type
    };

    // Step 3: Transmit the event to the blockchain for logging
    const eventPath = `${appPath}/metrics/events/${eventPayload.timestamp}`;
    const result = await ain.db.ref(eventPath).setValue({
      value: eventPayload,
      nonce: -1,
    });

    console.log('Event Propagation Result:', result);

    // Optional: Store the detailed metrics off-chain for further analysis (e.g., in a local database)
    // storeMetricsOffChain(eventPayload); // Implement this function if needed

  }, 5000); // Collect metrics every 5 seconds
}

// Start monitoring and logging
monitorAndLogMetrics();
```

|------------------|------------|----------------------------------------------|

### Monitoring Data Structures

The system aggregates key metrics from the container environment and logs these as structured events for each monitoring period or condition.

**Example of a Monitoring Event JSON**:
```json
{
  "containerId": "container_123",
  "timestamp": 1634491234,
  "gpuUsage": 75.3,
  "memoryUsage": 60.5,
  "temperature": 68.7,
  "eventType": "gpu_monitoring"
}
```

## 5. Security and Integrity Considerations

- **Event Integrity**: Each event is hashed before being transmitted to the blockchain to ensure immutability and non-repudiation. This ensures that even off-chain events are traceable on-chain.
- **Data Encryption**: Metrics and transaction events are encrypted during transmission to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
- **Real-Time Verification**: Blockchain nodes can verify the validity of the event hash stored on-chain, ensuring the integrity of off-chain event propagation.
- **Threshold Alerts**: For monitoring events, thresholds (e.g., GPU usage >90%) can trigger alerts, allowing immediate intervention.

## 6. Conclusion

This design document outlines a comprehensive solution for real-time transaction event propagation in off-chain containers. By capturing critical events from AI model training and inference, and monitoring container metrics such as GPU usage, the system ensures that relevant data is securely transmitted and logged. This provides both performance monitoring and traceability through blockchain integration.

## 7. Future Work

- **Integration with AI Model Lifecycle Management**: Extend event propagation to cover the entire AI model lifecycle, including deployment and retraining phases.
- **Automated Alerts and Auto-Scaling**: Integrate automated response mechanisms such as container auto-scaling based on real-time monitoring events.
- **Machine Learning-Driven Anomaly Detection**: Use machine learning models to detect abnormal patterns in container metrics, allowing early intervention in case of potential failures.
